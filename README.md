# CatIB-TS

Repository for parsing, plotting and analysis of an _Escherichia coli_ strain library producing glucose dehydrogenase from _Bacillus subtilis_ (_Bs_GDH) as Catalytically active Inclusion Bodies (CatIBs). The overall goal is to perform consecutive screening experiments using a Bayesian process model and Thompson Sampling as a policy to select candidates.

This projects provides the raw data and data analysis notebooks for the manuscript __"High-Throughput Screening of Catalytically Active Inclusion Bodies Using Laboratory Automation and Bayesian Optimization"__ (2023) by Laura M. Helleckes*, Kira KÃ¼sters*, Christian Wagner, Rebecca Hamel, Ronja Saborowski, Wolfgang Wiechert, Marco Oldiges.
